# Atomic Wallet Source Code - 2.69.2
I lost $22,000 in the security flaw of Atomic Wallet 2.69.2, and I am providing the source code for you to help me identify any possible vulnerabilities.

I will provide a tutorial for you to decompile the version of your Atomic Wallet as well.

1째 - Install NodeJS on your computer and then execute the following commands:<br>
2째 - cd C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\atomic\resources\app.asar<br>
3째 - npm install -g @electron/asar<br>
4째 - npx asar app.asar atomicsourcecode<br>

To make the code easier to read, use the tool https://beautifier.io/ to format the source code.

I will also provide a tutorial to open the developer tool in the Atomic Wallet application and monitor network traffic:
Press CTRL+SHIFT+I in your Atomic Wallet application. It will open the Chrome developer tool since the app is based on Chromium and Electron.

I hope someone can identify who did this and help us recover our funds.
Best regards!


It was a lot of work to uncover all of this. If you could assist me in any way by making a donation to the BTC wallet below, I would be very grateful.
